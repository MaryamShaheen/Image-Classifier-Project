# AI Programming with Python Project

Project code for Udacity's AI Programming with Python Nanodegree program. In this project, students first develop code for an image classifier built with PyTorch, then convert it into a command line application.


### The project is broken down into multiple steps:

- Load and preprocess the image dataset
- Train the image classifier on your dataset
- Use the trained classifier to predict image content
